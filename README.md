Summary of the CS255 System Analysis and Design course. 


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
   The owner of DriverPass was Liam, his goal was to fill the gap in the drivers education space. His goal is to provide better drivers education in hope to increase the percentage of new drivers who pass the DMW test their first try. 
   The client wanted a web application on cloud services that would allow users to purchase package deals, take practice tests, view results and book time with driving instructors. The client also wanted administrator controls that would allow them to 
   reset passwords, disable certain package deals, cancel bookings and recieve notificantions from DMV policy updates. 

What did you do particularly well?
   On the DriverPass sytem what i did particularly well was the UML diagrams such as the use case diagrams and sequence diagrams. What i did paticularly well was that I did not complicate the diagrams, I tried to be succinct with the diagrams
   to avoid confusing the non-technical audience. 
   
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   If i could revise on of my documents it would be the UML class diagram, even though it was not required I would add the functions of all the classes just so I can further my understanding of the system. With that I would hope to gain a better look
   at the big picture. 
   
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   When collecting system requirements or user needs I take notes on what the system needs to do to fulfill these needs, then I try to visualize what that would look like. When trying to visualize what that looks like UML diagrams 
   are the most helpful way to do that. Also, at times when collection or interpreting user needs I draw inspiration from how I have seen these problems solved before. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
   When designing software I would use the strategies I have learned thus far that have been most useful,  these are the Design documents/ business requirements documents. Having these documents saves time and reduces the likelyhood of having to view your interview notes. This is because the important details have already been put into those documents. When these documets are filled out correctly all the information to create digrams is in one place.
